      Math is a funny thing. I think many people tend to see it as magic and never attempt to demystify it, even those who use math on a daily basis. My aim is to do exactly that. Let's take a harder look at the real cause and effect that makes up, well, cause and effect. (Arguing for particular math foundations quickly becomes a recursive one, as you can see).

      This app is designed to allow you to play around with real math structures and see what happens when they combine to form larger structures. What might you stumble upon?
